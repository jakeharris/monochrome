I think the mansion room shuffling may not work out how we'd like. We'll see. I'm afraid players will get frustrated with the mechanic
####Jessie Chapman
We'll see

I gotta go <3

####unknownhybrid
Also, how will we make a game of variable length with only a particular amount of content? How do we "stage" the game so that at first there are bones, then bones and wolves, then all three? What puzzles are meaningful if things are random?

####Jessie Chapman

the way around the random coming out of doors is to maybe have it only happen on that floor

but also remember if they leave the door open they can leave as normal
####unknownhybrid
yeah, okay. I thought of that again yesterday, but thought it was a new idea (the door open thing). maybe that would be enough to make it okay

okay we need to start thinking of the house's aesthetic, nail down the monsters, and figure out a few (maybe one or two) sample rooms. maybe 1-2 for "plot rooms" and 1-2 for "puzzle rooms"

also, I added you as collaborator to the github

please feel free to tamper with it as you deem appropriate

but if we have a good idea, one of us needs to write it there

should one of us be assigned to that?
####Jessie Chapman
can't it not be both?

####unknownhybrid
if it's both, then I think one of the two of us will imagine the other did it sometimes

and neither of us will

and we'll lose ideas

####Jessie Chapman
fair

####unknownhybrid
mk

so which of us prefers to do that? it's not hard, but I do already know how to do it, so that's relevant

####Jessie Chapman
you can if youd like  

if youd rather not i have no issuye

####unknownhybrid
hm

I think since you'll be a lot more in direct control of, say, the look and feel design, and that's coming up next
it makes sense for me to do it, since that helps balance out the work a bit better

so what was that idea

####Jessie Chapman
?

####unknownhybrid
semirandom map generation, that re-randomizes if a player closes all the entrances to the room. this will guarantee no new enemies will enter or leave, but will also reshuffle the map on at least one floor of the house

####Jessie Chapman
that sounds corect

which is great if there is always one 'scary as f*ck' room

####unknownhybrid
why is that?

I'd think to force the player to close all exits in or out, the creature would have to be wandering
we also have to note, though

this is a negative feedback loop, so we should be careful how punishing it is

because what this says is, "if the player is already failing (i.e. they have attracted a monster), then introduce confusion"

####Jessie Chapman
fair

####unknownhybrid
that doesn't mean we should throw this idea out, but maybe find some way to make it a little less punishing

because I like the mystery of the shifting rooms, and I like the fear induced by shuffling when you thought you kinda knew where the bad guys were
