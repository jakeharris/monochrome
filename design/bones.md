# Bones
** Name is a W.I.P **

## Mechanics

## Theme
Bones represent structure and stillness. Think **super-ego**, think **the enemy of entropy**, think 
** homogeny. ** When things are quiet and calm, nothing is alive, but nothing is fleeting. Everything 
is permanent. Strong. Held together with more than the bandages around your heart.
