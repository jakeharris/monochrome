1a.       Have each resident in the house have a shallow backstory. Since the characters in the house are a result of a death there, then their triad (ghoul/bones/wolf) would show markings of their death. Wolves, honestly, not so much.

For example: "Frank Bahrnam", a wannabe gangster in 1928 found himself hiding from the city's top dog's henchman in the house after stealing a suitcase with a half million dollars inside. His crazy stunt to make a name for himself ends with his hands chopped off and his left side resembling a colander. As a result, the house has a room with a round or six worth of holes in the room of Frank's death, as well as a bones with many many bullet wounds, and a ghoul with a "holy" tailored silk suit and cigar. 

It'd be a lot of work, but I think that it'd be worth it. Go little (details) or go home, etc.

 b.       Oh! -and when there are all three parts of person are together they can talk or something like that. Maybe tell you their story in some sort of way?
