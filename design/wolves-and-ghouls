# Wolves
Wolves are vulnerable to ghouls and strong against/favor bones. They are invisible in light,
shimmery and mostly visible in the dark, and solid and opaque when in a combat situation.

Sight-based detection. Attack the player alone, but will howl upon hearing a bones rattle?
Or something that draws more wolves in if there are multiple bones.

# Ghouls
Ghouls are always visible, slow-moving, and silent. They are vulnerable to bones and strong
against/favor wolves. They are basically the material possessions of other mansion-goers
stuffed into their skin. When they attack the player, it curses them, drawing near all small
and loose items in the environment so as to make the player a ghoul (by forcing the items
into the player).
